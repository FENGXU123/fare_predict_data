{"sentence": "As based in the US we cannot invest  CAC is high vs revenue per customer. This doesn't feel like it will generate the levels of returns ADV would expect to see - it's a great idea, and good social impact but there's not enough information in this deck to see how NutriVentures achieves ��7.5bn of ��20bn market."}
{"sentence": "Great impact, very little info on the team or scale of market opportunity, defensibility is around the Brand and the content capturing its audience, not based on smart defensible tech, may scale but not to the extent we'd seek, as such I don't see this a proposition in line with ADV's investment strategy. ADV at present cannot invest in non-UK companies."}
{"sentence": "Experienced looking team and decent traction but from the deck and info provided I've no sense of what the value proposition is for consumers (and why differentiated and therefore will win on that side of the market, if it's consumer rewards, that's not unique is it?). Also missing the big long term vision, the business model, high level financial projections and how the funds raised will be used to build value - as such very hard for an investor to form a view here (pitch addresses the platform, up to a point, but not the investment opportunity). It's a big market opportunity but can't see what Dabbl is aiming for in that or how they get there. Also at present ADV cannot invest in non-UK companies."}
{"sentence": "Sadly we cannot progress this opportunity at this stage due to location - Liechtenstein. That said I believe football would benefit from more transparency and the power of the crowd.   The opportunity feels like Fan Duel meets Football manager meets investment broker destruction. Love it!"}
{"sentence": "Super clever guy and very impressive and definitely knows his business. He surrounded himself with multiple MBAs,PHDs Msc and such. They are profitable already and strong positioned in China so we might be just after the inflection point, but still an interesting opportunity. He wants to grow more in China and surrounding including S.america so there is still plenty to go. Valuation very high, and he's very confident in his product so might be hard to push down."}
{"sentence": "The opportunity is big on paper how not clear what are the margins they can actually take in the long term.  Not clear what the big vision is and are they looking to become the winner on a global scale or only in Europe.   Can this produce venture returns? meaning at least 100m in annual revenue, not clear from the deck.   Seems like the business is European and not UK based so ADV can not invest."}
{"sentence": "Setting aside that this is a non-UK deal I do not believe we can invest unless the team move here. This is good example of the type of investment opp we would like to engage with when we start to internationalise.   Smart investors - I note the former Chairman of ML being an investor, dont know whether he is tech savvy or just a good guy to have around. I suspect the latter. Which other independent investors are currently engaged or planning to engage? I also dont quite understand how they can achieve SEIS and EIS status given their domicile - worth understanding.     Opportunity - seems like a scalable product, but would really like to understand what that product (deliverable) is. Lots of terms banded about in the presentation e.g. protection of routers, but how? cloud SW I assume and not embedded on the device.   Team - look great! enough said. But failed to explain what the product (deliverable) actually is. I sense prototype with some PM fit.   Timing - we live in a world of multiple threats. We will connect the next trillion devices to the internet over the next decade. The time to improve device governance and identity protection is an ongoing task. I'd love to see some diverse suppliers in this space and ideally from reputable parts of the world!"}
{"sentence": "Timing of a proposition that addresses the challenge of continuing rising fuel costs for fleet operators (and private vehicle owners) could be positive, however it's unclear  what the size of the market opportunity is here - is that a question of displacing exisiting fuel card providers and taking a slice of that market or attracting new users (i.e. private users ), as such I have no sense of the founders' view of the market scale and what their strategy is to enter and win that market, if the financials do reflect the market opportunity, then this is not a big enough opportunity relative to ADV's scale big investment strategy (��100m+ revenue model). I would also be concerned about the defensibility of this model (replicable by others, e.g. the exisiting fuel card providers who have the exisiting customer relationships?). Team have good industry domain experience, but query if this team could scale DM. ADV is only able to invest in UK based companies."}
{"sentence": "great looking team with some real traction - my main concern is location - is this a UK business?  This could really solve a massive pain point and bring real benefit to users and app providers and advertisers"}
{"sentence": "There are many companies trying to do exactly the same thing, some of which are very well funded but still haven't been able to generate substantial outcomes. In order to this to be considered credibly we would need to see the team develop an MVP to demonstarte they are the ones to make this business model work. Non-UK."}
{"sentence": "Probably too early for ADV and outside the UK hence not an option for us. But in the sake of transparency, my feedback would be that it doesn't feel you are solving a large enough problem that you could universally serve with a scalable solution. I'm positive with the team you have you can build a great product, expertise and data but you probably still didn't figure out how your technology or business model will solve a pain point in a scalable way. In this case, it feels like a small market and very sales driven. I would start raising from Family offices/angels and work around the idea before getting venture monies."}
{"sentence": "I am not sure start ups fail due to a lack of access to information, and would also be concerned about the defensibility  of Parrity and the scalability of its subscription revenue model. The submission is v scant on a team, would suggest the founder builds a team around him, we, and most investors, invest in teams. Also at present ADV cannot invest in non-UK companies."}
{"sentence": "In theory sounds like an interesting idea - what comes after the cloud storage though?  There isn't a lot of information to differentiate from eg Google drive...  In any case, ADV is currently unable to invest outside the UK."}
{"sentence": "Amazing traction, its hard to see these here in the UK at Seed stage. It seems you're on to something, although 2017-18 is relative slow YoY growth.  If this was a UK opportunity I would be interested to see how you scale this faster, also the team slide was missing for me. I wish you good luck."}
{"sentence": "As you are a non-UK based company ADV cannot consider you for investment for the time being. I like the mission to connect corporates to charities while driving employee engagement. I would suggest connecting with Mustard Seed VC, a London based social impact VC. I would consider testing to see what business model works. It feels like your unit of value should only be Saas subscriptions to businesses. Taking a % of money raised to charities could be viewed as opportunistic."}
{"sentence": "ADV's investment mandate extends to companies addressing global generation defining problems with proprietary new software and which have a material/primary presence in the UK. As such Wax Wali is outside of our scope."}
{"sentence": "Our mandate doesn't stretch to Tallin, I assume you have engaged with the good folks of Change Ventures? What did they think?  You are right that that commercial real estate broking is an old boys/girls club, needs more transparency. How will you win the inventory owners?"}
{"sentence": "ADVs investment remit does not extend to the US at this point in time.  Before approaching investors I would update your deck to include a vision of the future that clearly outlines what you're trying to build, for whom and how this is monetised in a way that generates a significant commercial opportunity."}
{"sentence": "A great business with strong traction and an interesting team (Depop co-founder). A little confused about the fact they're both down as CEO but only one has it on their LinkedIn... Thought the doc shared was simple and it'd be worth finding out more except they're non-UK so we probably can't invest."}
{"sentence": "This is a very crowded space and I think this will end up being a space of many, versus one dominant outcome. I, therefore, think this will succeed but not to the scale required to attract VC investment. This is also based outside the UK which is outside of the parameters of the current fund. I wish the team well as this is an admirable thing to do."}
{"sentence": "Thank you for your interest in ADV. As we are focused on UK and Ireland based companies and given you are based in Singapore, we wouldn't be able to consider you for invest for the time being. Please do consider us again for your next raise as we expand our geographical remit. Thank you."}
{"sentence": "ADVs investment remit doesn't extend to the US, yet.  Therefore we are unable to progress your application any further.  Your investment deck was well put together and there is clearly a talented science team in place.  Before continuing to approach investors I would advise working on clarification of what the potential market opportunity is to you, showcasing the learnings and key metric validations from existing customer engagements and focussing on what the Company looks like after deploying this investment (i.e. what key milestones will validate further fundraising)."}
{"sentence": "As someone who is just recently married, I'm aware of the cost and stress associated with wedding dresses so there could indeed be a lucrative marketplace here.  Especially if you are able to extend into different cultures and areas of the wedding event.  The lack of financial forecasts within your deck leaves an investor unable to appraise the long-term potential of Devotion so I would include these in future.  As ADV cannot currently invest in companies outside of the UK we are unable to progress the application any further.  I wish you and the Devotion team all the best moving forward."}
{"sentence": "ADV's investment mandate currently only extends to companies with a primary UK presence, sounds like you are more US based and as such  likely to be outwith our scope. However a few comments on the pitch; a smart team and a good clear deck -  clearly a big challenge to address in managing and leveraging value from personal data, however a much busier space than the deck alludes to and have seen a number of other start ups (and larger cos) addressing the same problem -  struggling to understand Datacy's differentiation from them and why you will win big. Perhaps that's a symptom of how early the proposition is. Good progress to date, at this stage and for this model, crowdfunding could be a route to raising and building up a group of early engaged adopters/users."}
{"sentence": "ADV is unable to invest outside the UK at present.  In terms of your presentation, it would have been good to understand what your long term ambition for your company is; you talk about the product and the market but not really about why an investor should be interested."}
{"sentence": "The way this is presented, this comes across as a technology solution looking for a problem to fix. There is little if any information about the size of the market (and hence opportunity) here and I cannot get comfortable that the problem outlined is big enough for users (or organisations to which they belong) to want to pay for a solution. It. would be helpful to see some initial feedback from target users. Additionally, ADV are only looking to invest in UK based companies at this time."}
{"sentence": "ADV can currently only invest in UK companies, so this is not suitable for us at this stage.   In terms of the pitch I note you use live teachers, but you don't address security, privacy, certifications, language... E.g. my sons school just made recordings of all sessions mandatory over safeguarding concerns - this is something that you at a minimum need to have a stated strategy for how you want to handle."}
{"sentence": "As this is not a UK based business this falls outside of our current fund thesis and therefore we would be unable to invest. However I think until this is proven market fit and gaining traction, ie series A onwards it could then be something VC will look at but at this stage its really too early and Angel investors or family and friends type investors are probably more relevant"}
{"sentence": "A few reasons why I don't believe this is one for us: 1. the business is still at ideation stage where as we invest in business who has tested their MVP 2. the business is outside of the UK and 3. the projected revenue is too small for it to be venture backable."}
{"sentence": "As in Israel we cannot invest  No numbers in the deck; and no sense of how they deliver or what they have built. Huge market and lots of ways to address it but not enough information in this to make a reasonable assessment"}
{"sentence": "Looks like a great team with a good proposition although in a very competitive industry with many competitors in the industry.   Sadly at the moment ADV does not invest in companies not operating in the UK"}
{"sentence": "Strong, experienced team, with scalable business model, a view of the global market opportunity (vs US only) would have been useful. An increasingly crowded space, with larger players, is ARImaging���s the technology sufficiently defensible to create advantage long enough to win a sizeable portion of the market? Timing to market is key therefore, global go to market strategy required to assess if there could be a scale big (��100m+ revenue opportunity) here in line with ADV���s investment strategy, however at present we are unable to invest in non-UK businesses."}
{"sentence": "Seems like team is Spain based with only 1 person in the UK, not clear if they have operations in UK [ADV only invests in business operating in the UK]   The idea seems great and the change in industry massive however not clear on the big vision and how will they win on a global scale. Seems like a very short term focus with not much revenue to be able to be VC fundable."}
{"sentence": "Experienced team from the space, they seem to have a good product with decent traction. I do miss data in the deck such as their business model, financials and future pipeline or even broader vision. SAM is big enough but how much can they grab of it. Seems they're abroad as well which is out of our scope for now."}
{"sentence": "Amsterdam based so unable to support at this stage.  There is a business here - I think the slides could be clearer on the service proposition and the business model - platforms don't usually work on a Saas basis.  There is also very little on the product roadmap - where the product is now and where it will go in the future"}
{"sentence": "Sadly team is not UK based so ADV can't invest - We focus on UK and IRL based business at the moment.   The opportunity is huge and the market as well however it's not clear what is the product and how can it scale to become a 100m annual revenue company which is what as VCs we are looking to invest in.   From the deck it is not clear why is the solution unique and how can it scale."}
{"sentence": "Interesting platform to help maximise networking value of events to organisers and participans. Unfortunately, as they are not a UK based company, is not one that ADV can consider for investment for the time being."}
{"sentence": "US company we can't invest, ADV is focused on UK and IRL teams.  Idea is interesting however not clear on GTM and how will he compete with the current location services market and the ability to provide instant location with mobile phone. How will this feature develop into a full product defensible long term"}
{"sentence": "The risk and potential size of outcome in games development is not venture backable, as such this opportunity is not for ADV. The pitch deck is not clear and does not read well, the financial plan does not look to be accurate. At present ADV can only invest in UK companies."}
{"sentence": "I love the benefit they are offering their customers a more affordable and more effective way to enabling independence for adults with anxiety and autism allowing them to be freer, socially integrated and no longer shut in.  I'm not sure they have a large enough market for the app and think we should recommend them to social impact funds."}
{"sentence": "Experienced and balanced looking team, but opportunity does not look large enough in which to build a scale big (��100m+ revenue and growing ) company in line with ADV's investment strategy (even in absence of some high level projections to demonstrate the founders' view of the opportunity they aim to build in the opportunity they see). Also at this time ADV cannot invest in non-UK companies."}
{"sentence": "Very early and unproven plus requiring lots of equipment which doesn't fit ADV model.  Novel idea which would benefit from some angel investment to see whether there is a real business and how big it could be."}
{"sentence": "Attacking a big and lucrative market as ADV has already previously acknowledged.  They know their market well and are looking at the less exploited countries, which is good.  The team looks to have strong foundations.  Stats are already heading in the right direction and they are forecasting a clear route to $100m in a reasonable time frame.  Unfortunately, this is non-uk but this has not affected the score."}
{"sentence": "The Woolf team right identify the traditional university model is failing (students, academics and its funders) and is ripe for disruption, however the submission for me only addresses the pain points and the concept of how Woolf may address them,  it doesn't however articulate a business model that can be backed, e.g. no view of the size of the addressable market opportunity, a go to market strategy to acquire students or academics, clear economics of the model or what financial scale the proposition aims to grow to. From the website this looks to be a token sale, which is outwith ADV's scope, as is investment in non-UK businesses."}
{"sentence": "It seems you operate outside the UK and thus outside our mandate unfortunately. Great progress till now, wasn't clear for me the current metrics on the x thousand of users that are using it but it seems you're getting the French market with appr 300 mrr in y3? Seems a bit low, I would think bigger because this is a huge market and ready for a smarter 2nd Spotify. Nothing really about the team, which is super important at this stage! (ps provide subtitle for the video, good start for going global)"}
{"sentence": "Sadly ADV only invests in UK based business so can't move on this. I think the idea is great but the deck doesn't actually say how and why will they be able to build this? who is the team and what's the relevant experience."}
{"sentence": "A sizeable problem in (in)fertility, for which the solutions/resources exist but the challenge is around better timely access to the right resources., can see a need for a model to connect those resources with the people who need them. Team have domain expertise but critically lack a tech co-founder which will preclude many tech investors (incl. ADV). Model is very fragmented and unfocused, why build elements when you can partner (e.g. with Push Dr for video consultations). I don't see anything technically very defensible here, so critical to quickly build a large moat of users, but no sense of a strategy for that in this (lengthy) deck. Great intent, but would suggest the founders join an accelerator to focus the model on where they can create real defensible value in their ecosystem and find a tech co-founder."}
{"sentence": "As you are a non UK or Ireland based company ADV can't consider you for investment for the time being.   I do wonder fundamentally how rich and the building data is that can be derived from satellite images and how relevant that data is at providing a full picture for insurers on the underlying asset value/risk.  There are several other startups in the insurtech space using multiple sources including a blend of image based and scraping publicly available information on buildings/companies."}
{"sentence": "Great initiative Afonso, facing a problem you had in your previous career by now trying hard as an entrepreneur is very much appreciated. Unfortunately, we cannot invest in a company that operates outside the UK/Ireland. Just to give you a bit of feedback, I'm sure this market is massive with a big TAM/SAM etc , but it would be more fruitful to see the potential revenue curve, or perhaps the Unit of Economics per user. I noticed you currently have 1.3k what are the economics and how will they change when you reach a mil, and obviously the pace of it and how."}
{"sentence": "As a non-UK based company ADV can't consider you for investment for the time-being. While it looks like you are still developing your concept at this point, I would consider refining your focus. It looks like you're currently aiming to tap into the growing trends focusing on wellness and wellbeing, however I think you're coming in late to serve those markets. Other platforms like Classpass and MoveGB are ahead of you on the activity front and can eventually add in the full platform of content, nutrition etc."}
{"sentence": "The idea seems good not clear how they plan to scale, at core getting XXXM users is the main value for advitisers and not clear the value that will make users move from app stores and web internet to Cygnus.   Sadly it's also a non UK based team so we can't move this forward."}
{"sentence": "This seems like a great team and idea. That said, it is a business that should be angel funded, perhaps also strategics (food industry companies or the hardware suppliers). The reason is that it does not seem it will scale to a venture returns model in 5-7 years."}
{"sentence": "ADV's investment mandate only extends to companies with a primary/material presence in the UK, as such Blocksport is outside our scope. As feedback on the deck; smart team, building in a large, fast emerging market opportunity however the deck lacked the founders' long term vision of the company they can build - what does esports and Blocksport look like in say 7+ years - that's the journey you're asking investors to join."}
{"sentence": "I am not a fan of doing things in this space as the behaviours are driven by skewed interests and it really hard to see how that can be shifted and venture capital returns being captured. In any case, ADV is not currently mandated to directly invest in non-UK based or centred opportunities and that is the case here so ADV is not the right investment partner for this company."}
{"sentence": "I think the simplicity of your proposition. There's a lot of new product ideas you could layer on top of this as it grows also. My concern would be that its too niche. Doesn't my iPhone already enable me to create a folder with baby photos (playing devil's advocate). Either way, we're unable to back companies based outside the UK and so couldn't invest. Good luck in the future!"}
{"sentence": "The company is based outside of the UK so it's out of the geography we invest in. The market is really big but with many competitors. So without some really special smarts or differentiation it's going to be hard for the company to achieve a venture investible outcome."}
{"sentence": "would suggest Vidar reviews the deck and determine whether it makes sense as an opportunity and then meet the team .  Is this really a UK or a US business?"}
{"sentence": "ADV only invests in UK based business at the moment and this is a US based company."}
{"sentence": "They're not even in the US - the mobile no of the founder is in Ukraine...  I do think they're massively underestimating the potential of this - but the potential only really is reached through partnering with MANY others and there's a lot of hardware in there too"}
{"sentence": "Based in Kenya so we can't.  Interesting idea; current plans too small for us anyway. Not a lot of info in the flyer.   Chief scientist based in the UK, interestingly... Might be worth looking at for scrums etc?"}
{"sentence": "They do seem to be based in Switzerland not London as they state  Not sure that the sizing is sufficiently clear on this but worth asking the question.   What IS their differentiator vs competitors (they say they have one but not what it is)? Have seen a couple of similar things but they've not been quite usable yet: is it just that they HAVE a product which is selling or do they actually operate differently? I like this but is it a today problem that in 5 years won't exist because everything will work like this (ie do they become the standard or become redundant because once it's done once, anyone can do it)?"}
{"sentence": "If the CEO is in the Uk (he has an italian mobile number) then we should meet him. Their may be more to his desire to win that comes across in the paper. Its a borderline 1-2.   This is another ICO play and based in Italy, certainly easier to see how the team can relocate to the UK than the Russian \"Diesel\" team I huddled yesterday. Team - look good, not convinced they are great in any aspect of gamification or AR. Very difficult to tell from the profiles in the deck. What is this the A team - they really should be confident and shout this from the rooftops. Opportunity - I personally dont like geotagging games having done this once in Croatia on a team building session, I can see how kids will interact with this though and brands are desperate to re-invent consumer engagement with a blend of physical and digital. I can make the leap towards the business model (coin rewards) and brands wishing to engage and pay. AR and VR has had two stalled attempts to reach mass markets in my lifetime 2006 and again in 2010, the latter was when ARM and Imagination technologies start to push GPU's as the underlying tech required to make AR mainstream. Spots of goodness resulted in the eco-system. Pokemon Go. Cant see how this team will redefine the industry or a generation."}
{"sentence": "Large market opportunity, and showing decent early traction, we've seen many English teaching platforms and not really clear to me what Novakid's key differentiator is and why that creates defensibility, also note the reliance on having a sufficient supply (quality and quantity) of real human teachers - which may hamper scaling. Also, ADV cannot invest in non UK companies, so Novakid is not a proposition for ADV."}
{"sentence": "Non UK so limits ADV's ability to invest. The thing that's missing for me is a true problem description - how do cat owners know they have this problem and where is it demonstrated that they want to address this. Sizeable marketing challenge to bring customers to this but significant thought gone into the the go to market. Huge team for such and early stage."}
{"sentence": "ADV can't invest outside UK at this time. Also, this is a space that is rapidly getting crowded and while you may not have competition in your geography at present it will likely take a bigger vision to realise venture scale returns."}
{"sentence": "There have been a huge number of SaaS for NGO / Gov operations created and funded this past few years, I don't see any evidence here around product / tech which takes care of the sales cycle in the absence of which it will be very hard to build a big business in the space. Also  ADV is currently only mandated to invest in UK based businesses or businesses with substantial UK operations and that is not the case here so this is not a fit for ADV."}
{"sentence": "As ADV is currently not mandated to invest in companies without a material presence in the UK we are unable to progress any further with the application at this point.  I wish you the best of luck with your venture."}
{"sentence": "Quite possibly the most heavily resourced early stage start-up i've seen! A significant team! I'm concerned that while this is a market, it's not a sizeable market and therefore long term opportunity (from an investment perspective). Very early stage concept, would recommend working with an local accelerator to prove out/develop the concept. Additionally, it's non-UK meaning out of scope for ADV at this time."}
{"sentence": "Non UK, not sure where this is going but doing what competitors are doing, just better or harder, rarely leads to winning a market. You have to find ways to do things differently. Team and dashboard look great. Good luck"}
{"sentence": "Very impressive growth and coverage. This seems a Dutch based company which might be out of our boundaries but to ignore the location I'm not sure how you scale this to a ��100m business. I would like to see your point of view on how you���ll reach and convince customers to use and buy what you���re offering.  ���Winning on product��?alone is a rare, minority case, what is your competitive advantage on the distribution of the product and GTM, as you're dealing with many giants who will open it up for the whole probably for at some point. Would like to see these things in the deck together with growth projections and unit economics."}
{"sentence": "ADV currently only invests in UK businesses so would be unable to help. In terms of your business proposition, we have seen a number of businesses trying to digitise legal workflows and there is a definite market opportunity - the scale of your ambition seems to be quite limited with an early trade sale the intended outcome and this is unlikely to excite venture investors - angels may be more appropriate at this stage."}
{"sentence": "Outside UK so not currently applicable for ADV. I don't see any long term projections here, and also seems like a mish-mash of features without any indication why users would want this or how you'd overcome the massive network-effect challenges in the messaging space."}
{"sentence": "Looks like a very solid business which I'm sure the market has a need for. Follows the Infarm approach to future of food in super markets. Regardless of this, we're unable to invest outside the UK and so can't progress this any further."}
{"sentence": "I'm not sure these guys are ready to raise capital. The team would be best served to raise a small amount of capital from an industry angel or accelerator programme before looking for VC. Seems at a very early stage and we wouldn't invest now. We also cannot invest in companies based outside the UK unfortunately."}
{"sentence": "Interesting path to AR, it has had put aside in the past couple of years by investors as the market is not as big as one thought.  Having said that, creating an AR network might intrigue potential investors. We unfortunately can't invest as you operate outside the UK and at a very early stage. You should identify investors who would be interested at this stage and sector."}
{"sentence": "I'm afraid we aren't able to progress the application any further as our investment remit does not currently extend to the US.  Given the early-stage nature of Plutoview, I would suggest that you try to either raise angel investment or join a credible accelerator programme, either of which will provide you with key initial capital to test and prove fundamental assumptions that will act as a springboard to raise institutional capital."}
{"sentence": "ADV's investment mandate only extends to companies with a material/primary presence in the UK, as such MainBloq is outside our scope. As a comment on the deck; it gives no real sense of the size of the market opportunity that the founders see and the scale of company they aim to build in that over the long term - that's the journey you're asking investors to join."}
{"sentence": "Our current fund only allows us to invest in UK based businesses at the moment, please bear us in mind for your next round as this may change. Thank you for considering ADV as an Investor and good luck in pulling this round together"}
{"sentence": "The link to the pdf you shared is broken. It seems you've deleted the file. In any case, as you're not based in the UK or Ireland, ADV cannot consider you for investment for the time being. If you haven't done so already, I would suggest making sure your materials reflect why your business isn't just tech that is sold or licensed to existing dating platforms to increase their security rather than what you seem to be targeting which is building up a new dating platform from scratch. The dating app market is already a crowded one and would caution you to think carefully about how you will make yourself heard in a noisy market and better security alone doesn't feel like it will be a strong enough hook."}
